These are the instructions for compiling, and running the dANN examples
application. These instructions assume you have already followed the
instructions in the dANN Core Library README file. If you've downloaded the
binary distribution, skip the compilation portion of this document.


Description:

dANN is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Artificial Intelligence suite
intending to incorporate conventional techniques as well as entirely new
techniques inspired by biological systems. Some of the features included are:

 * Hyperassociative Map
 * 3D mapping and visualizations
 * Genetic Algorithms
 * Genetic Programming
 * Wavelet Genetics
 * ANN Connection Optimization
 * ANN Genetic Framework
 * Backprop ANN
 * Perceptron ANN
 * Layered Feedforward ANN
 * Fully/Partial Recurent ANN
 * Example Applications

The examples distribution provides you with several example applications that
shows you how to use the library as well as a demonstration of some of its
features.


Getting The Files:

There are several distributions available: you can export from svn, download
the source, or download the precompiled jar files. If you would like to export
the latest version from svn to the current directory the command is:

svn export svn://svn.syncleus.com/dANN/trunk/projects/java_dann_examples/

If you would like to obtain one of the latest versioned distributions simply get
one of the files found at:

http://files.syncleus.com/pub/dANN/latest/

If You would like an older version or snapshot you can go directly to:

http://files.syncleus.com/pub/dANN/


Compilation:

Assuming you obtained a source distribution in the previous step you will need
to continue with this step, otherwise skip ahead to "Running the Examples".

First we need to compile the examples application; change directory to the
java_dann_examples directory where the build.xml file resides. Next run the
following command:

ant clean compile

If you are developing and would like to display lint4j based warnings execute
the following command:

ant lint

You should now have the appropriate jar files in build/jar.



Running the Examples:

In order to use the application you either need to have obtained the binary
distribution or used the source distribution and successfully completed the
"Compilation" step above. Once compiled the core library will reside in the
following location:

build/jar/dann_examples.jar

You will want to invoke the dann_examples.jar file with the dann.jar in the
classpath as well as the following dependencies which can be found in the
lib directory:

lib/j3dcore.jar
lib/vecmath.jar
lib/j3dutils.jar

The examples application requires Java 1.6 (also called Java 6) in order to
compile and run. You can either invoke the dann_examples.jar file directly
by calling the java virtual machine with the above libraries in the class
path (as well as dann.jar) or you can simple change to the scripts directory
and invoke run.bat on windows or run.sh on Linux.

If you intend to run any of the 3D visualizations, such as the Hyperassociative
Map and Neural Image Compression, then you will need to have Java3D installed.
You can obtain Java3D at the following URL:
